          <div class="the-about">
            <p>The Unseen Generation is a movement led by <a href="zanele-radebe.html">Zanele Sbongile Radebe(19)</a> 
            to empower youth who feel invisible in society. The Unseen Generation is an advocacy movement that gives 
            voice to the overlooked, the unheard, and the underestimated youth of today. It stands for the teens who 
            feel invisible in classrooms, in conversations, and in opportunities — not because they lack potential, 
            but because the world hasn’t made space to truly see them. We represent the quiet dreamers, the late 
            bloomers, the emotionally strong, and those rising from difficult places. Our mission is to restore 
            confidence, dignity, and visibility to young people who’ve been made to feel like they don’t belong.
            Through storytelling, empowerment, emotional healing, and opportunities for growth, we aim to prove that 
            being unseen does not mean being unworthy.This is more than a message.It’s a reminder: You don’t need to 
            be loud to be powerful. You just need to be seen.</p>
