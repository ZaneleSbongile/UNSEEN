    <h2>Empowerment Fridays</h2>
    <p>For the youth. By one of you. To all of us. Empowerment Friday is more than a weekly video — it’s a movement 
      within a movement. Every Friday, we show up with truth, love, and honesty to remind young people that their 
      voice matters, their feelings are valid, and their story is still unfolding — beautifully. Whether it’s 
      confidence, healing, growth, or leadership, these episodes are here to ignite something in you, to remind you 
      that you are not alone, and to walk with you through the things many are too afraid to talk about. This is real 
      talk. Real life. Real empowerment. From one young person living it, to others needing it. So take what you 
      need. Share what speaks to you. And always remember: you’re not unseen here.

          <p>Redefining Beauty</p>
          <p> “This week we’re breaking beauty standards. Because real beauty isn’t filtered, edited, or boxed. It’s raw, bold, and real. Let’s redefine what beautiful means—on our terms.”</p>

          <p>Social Media vs. Reality</p>
          <p> “Today, we’re pulling back the curtain. Social media shows the highlights—not the whole story. Don’t compare your behind-the-scenes to someone else’s filter.”</p>
