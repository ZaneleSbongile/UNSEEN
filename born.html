      <h2>How The Unseen Generation Was Born</h2>
      <p>
        The Unseen Generation was born from a personal shift — a move that opened my eyes and stirred my purpose. 
        In 2024, I moved from Gauteng to QwaQwa. I didn’t expect that such a change in location would reveal such a 
        deep truth. I quickly noticed the difference in resources, opportunities, and exposure available to the 
        youth here. Where I came from, we had more access — to guidance, platforms, support systems. But here? Many 
        young people who are full of potential, yet living in silence, unnoticed. They are showing up every day, 
        pushing through circumstances, dreaming quietly — and yet, no one sees them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when I realized: this isn’t just a QwaQwa issue — it’s a national one. Maybe even global. There are 
        unseen youth everywhere. Not because they have less to offer, but because their environment gives them less 
        visibility, less support, <strong>less belief</strong>. And that’s when the mission became clear: To find them. Hear them. 
        Empower them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build a movement that reminds every overlooked teenager that they are still enough, still capable, and still 
        worthy of being seen. This is how The Unseen Generation was born — from one move, one moment, and one promise: 
        I may not see all of you yet. But I will do everything I can to make sure the world does.
