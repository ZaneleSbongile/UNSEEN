      <h2>How The Unseen Generation Was Born</h2>
      <p>
        The Unseen Generation was born from a personal shift — a move that opened my eyes and stirred my purpose. 
        In 2024, I moved from Gauteng to QwaQwa. I didn’t expect that such a change in location would reveal such a 
        deep truth. I quickly noticed the difference in resources, opportunities, and exposure available to the 
        youth here. Where I came from, we had more access — to guidance, platforms, support systems. But here? Many 
        young people were full of potential, yet living in silence, unnoticed. They were showing up every day, 
        pushing through circumstances, dreaming quietly — and yet, no one saw them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when I realized: this isn’t just a QwaQwa issue — it’s a national one. Maybe even global. There are 
        unseen youth everywhere. Not because they have less to offer, but because their environment gives them less 
        visibility, less support, less belief. And that’s when the mission became clear: To find them. Hear them. 
        Empower them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build a movement that reminds every overlooked teen that they are still enough, still capable, and still 
        worthy of being seen. This is how The Unseen Generation was born — from one move, one moment, and one promise: 
        I may not see all of you yet. But I will do everything I can to make sure the world does.
