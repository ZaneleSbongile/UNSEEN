    <h3>
      Hi, I'm Zanele Sbongile Radebe
    </h3>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm 19 years old, born and raised in Gauteng, Johannesburg, Katlehong. I‚Äôm currently studying Information 
      Technology at Richfield College, with a curiosity for how the digital world works and how I can use it to 
      make a difference.
    <br>
      Outside of the classroom, I love baking sweet things and making people smile through food. I‚Äôm also someone 
      who finds peace in reading, joy in volunteering, and purpose in growing into the woman I‚Äôm becoming.
    <br>
      I enjoy deep conversations, quiet mornings, and being around animals (dogs are my favorite!). I believe in 
      kindness, authenticity, and lifting others up. I don‚Äôt have it all figured out, but I believe that every day 
      is a new chance to become better than yesterday.
    <br>>
      One of my biggest dreams is to become Miss Teenager South Africa‚Äînot just for the title, but to represent 
      real girls with real stories, and to show that you can rise from anything. I also started <strong>The Unseen 
      Generation</strong>‚Äîa movement to empower youth who feel overlooked. But at the core, I‚Äôm just Zanele. A young 
      woman learning, evolving, and trying to do something meaningful with her life.
    <br>>
      <strong>This is my story, and it‚Äôs just beginning.</strong>
